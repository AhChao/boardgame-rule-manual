Molly House
Rules of Play
In the early 18th century, London was rapidly becoming 
one of the largest cities in Europe. Vibrant discussions 
about new ways of living were being hosted at coffee 
houses across the city. And in the backrooms of certain 
establishments, a community was being born. 
This was the thriving, underground world of the mol-
lies, pioneering explorers of gender and sexuality who 
built a community during this period of possibility and 
change. Bawdy songs rang out as bedecked mollies 
engaged in masquerades. The nights were filled with 
unsanctioned weddings and gin-soaked christenings. 
Molly House celebrates this community by inviting 
players to take the roles of these mollies as they navi-
gate their desires and dodge the watchful eyes of the 
Society for the Reformation of Manners, a citizen 
group that sought to stamp out any behavior it deemed 
deviant. 
During the game, players try to accumulate joy by 
throwing and participating in festivities. In prepara-
tion, they move around the board to collect vice cards 
to play at these festivities. Certain sites on the board let 
players use cards in their hands to build their reputa-
tions, which can improve later actions but also expose 
them to risk. Other sites—the shops—offer items that 
provide a variety of benefits.
At festivities, players will also score joy for the com-
munity. This is a crucial element of the game. In order 
for the community to survive, players must help the 
community pass its joy threshold by collaborating to 
throw the most magnificent festivities.
Of course, this collaboration comes at a price. Stag-
ing festivities and taking some actions will gradually 
increase the size of the gossip pile. Each week, this pile 
will be inspected, possibly generating evidence against 
the houses. With enough evidence, the Society will raid 
a molly house and indict those players with the highest 
reputation there. 
If sufficient evidence is generated over the course of 
the game, the wider community will be fully infiltrated, 
ending the game and leaving only those who success-
fully betrayed the community eligible to win.

Components
This section contains an accounting of all components as well as their general 
function. 
Board and Playmat
Molly House uses a four-panel board as well as a playmat. 
Rules and Aids
There are two rulebooks: this one and the solo rules. In addition 
there are two large aid sheets and five poker-sized aid cards. 
Game State Markers
There are seven game state markers. The gold octagon marks the 
current week. The black disc is used to mark community joy. The 
candelabra is used to indicate the current festivity runner and to 
determine the start player at the beginning of a week. 
In addition, each molly house has a token to indicate that it has 
been raided and a pair of tokens used to mark the adjacent cruis-
ing sites to show that they are now more dangerous. 
Cubes
There are sixteen cubes in each of the four suit colors. These cubes 
represent permanent reputation if in a player’s area or evidence 
against a molly house if on the board. 
Draw and Multiplier Tokens
There are ten draw tokens. These tokens indicate that a player will 
draw a card at the start of the next week. There are five multiplier 
tokens. Cubes and draw tokens are not piece limited. You may 
place either on a multiplier to indicate that it counts as three of 
that piece. 
Player Pieces
Each player has a joy marker, a pawn, a player board, and four 
encounter tokens in their color (one informer and three loyal). The 
joy marker indicates joy on the star side or hanged on the reverse. 
Dice
There are two custom six-sided dice, which are used for movement, 
and four ten-sided dice, which are used to record the values of 
rogues and resolve indictments. 
Small Cards
There are twenty item cards, eight major indictments, and eight 
minor indictments. 
Solo Game Components
For the solo game, there are four standard six-sided dice, a 25-card 
orchestration deck, five play/pass tokens, and four joker tokens. 
The solo game requires only four play/pass tokens, but we have included a 
fifth so that players may use them as an aid in multiplayer games to show 
who has passed.

Vice Cards
There are 52 vice cards that form the heart of Molly House. The three different 
types of vice cards are described here, along with their general game function. 
Many concepts and rules that are discussed in greater detail later are men-
tioned here in passing. 
Desires
These cards represent the different ges-
tures, desires, and encounters that were 
frowned upon by the Society for the 
Reformation of Manners. All desire cards 
have three important attributes: value, 
suit, and joy. A card’s suit and value are 
used to build festivities at molly houses. 
The stars on a card indicate the amount of 
joy gained when the card is scored during 
festivities. 
Desire cards also feature a fragment drawn 
from a period source and a citation. We have 
preserved the original spelling, punctuation, 
and capitalization.
Threats
There are two types of threats:  
constables (C) and rogues (R). If 
players ignore them, they can lead to 
the collapse of the community. How-
ever, by scoring them in festivities, 
you can protect the community and 
clear cards in your reputation. 
Unlike desires, these cards do not 
score joy. They also have a special 
effect when played during festivities. 
Constables feature the names of officials, 
while rogues are the names of known 
informers. 
Mollies
There are two types of mollies: jacks 
(J) and queens (Q). Mollies have a 
joy amount, which is used only in 
specific circumstances. In addition, 
mollies offer a scoring bonus. 
Each molly is modeled after a named 
historical counterpart. 
Both mollies and threats also in-
clude a reminder on the bottom 
right to place in the gossip pile if a 
market discard removes them from 
the market.

Player Setup:
10. Take a matching player board, pawn, and set of four 
encounter tokens. Keep the encounter tokens face down 
near your board. You may always look at them.
11. Deal Player Hands. Deal four vice cards to each player. If 
playing with two players, deal five cards instead. 
12. Place your joy marker on the “0” space of the winding 
joy track.
13. Each player secretly selects one card from their hand and 
places it face down in their reputation area to the left of 
their player board. Then, all players simultaneously reveal 
their card. They then place their pawn on the molly house 
that matches the card’s suit. Then:
 ƘIf it was a desire card, they score the amount of joy 
indicated on the card.
 ƘIf it was a threat card, add it to the safe pile (a face up 
discard pile placed anywhere near the area of play). 
 ƘIf it was a molly card, nothing further happens. Players 
often choose this option to score molly bonuses later (page 7).

General Rules and Concepts
Sharing Information
Players are free to talk about the game and their hands, but they may never di-
rectly reveal cards in their hands to other players unless instructed. As an exam-
ple, any player may freely declare that they have two sevens, but may not directly reveal 
those cards to verify it. They could be lying. Figuring out how much you should say about 
your hand and whom you should trust are two of the central challenges of the game!
Matching Pieces
Various rules in the game will refer to a “matching” game 
piece. Matching pieces are those that have or are associated 
with the same suit and color.
Hand Limits
Players must observe a hand size limit of six cards. Additional 
cards may be taken into your hand, but you must add any 
excess cards to the gossip pile face down at the end of your turn. 
The Gossip and Safe Piles
Throughout the game, cards are often added to the gossip pile, located on the 
bottom right corner of the board. All cards in this pile are face down; the order 
in which cards are added does not matter. 
The gossip pile is examined at the end of each week. If threats are discovered 
in the pile, it can lead to the gathering of evidence, the raiding of houses, the 
indictment of players, and the destruction of the wider community. 
In contrast to cards in the gossip pile, cards in the safe pile will not harm players 
or the community. The safe pile may be placed anywhere near the area of play, 
and it can be freely inspected at any time. 
Reputation
Throughout the game, players will add cards and cubes to their reputation, stor-
ing cards to the left of their player board and cubes on the player board itself. 
These cards and cubes are used to measure a player’s reputation in each of the 
game’s four suits. 
To determine player’s reputation in a specific suit, add up 
the total number of cubes and cards matching that suit in 
their reputation. A player’s reputation boosts their actions 
at matching sites but also makes them more vulnerable to 
indictments if that house is raided.
Reputations are public information, and any cards there 
should remain face up. During the game, cards will often 
leave a player’s reputation. In contrast, cubes in a  
reputation are never lost. 
Threats and Being Exposed
Throughout the game, threats will sometimes be added to the gossip pile. When 
this publicly happens, a specific player or players will be exposed. When a 
player is exposed, they must add all cards in their reputations matching the 
threat that triggered exposure to the gossip pile and take a matching cube 
for each. The various methods for determining who is exposed are described 
throughout the rules. 
All these  
things match.

Molly Bonuses
If a player has a molly in their reputation, they will score bonus 
joy when desires (numbered cards) in the matching suit are added 
to their reputation. This bonus is two joy with a matching jack, 
three joy with a matching queen, or five joy with both. 
During a festivity, it is possible that both mollies and desires will 
enter a player’s reputation at the same time. When this happens, 
add mollies before desires. This rule ensures that you gain your Molly 
Bonuses for newly added cards, even if those cards are then lost due to a 
threat at the same party (this is described later on page 11)! 
Loyalty and Informing
Players begin loyal to the molly houses. However, as houses are raided by the 
Society for the Reformation of Manners, players will be given opportunities 
to inform on other still-active houses. If an informer’s assigned house is raided 
before the end of the game, they will be granted a pardon for their past crimes 
and gain another path to victory if the Community Infiltration ending occurs. 
Sequence of Play
A game of Molly House is composed of up to five weeks. Each week is com-
posed of several rounds of player turns. On a player’s turn, they will usually 
move their pawn around the board and then take an action. Many of these 
actions deplete a central deck of cards, called the vice deck. 
If the vice deck is empty at the start of a player’s turn, they should take the 
candelabra and then resolve the End of the Week phases. That player will take 
their turn after resolving these phases so long as the game has not ended.
How the Game Ends
A game of Molly House may end when resolving the End of the Week phases. 
There are three different endings, and each uses a different method for  
determining the game’s winners and losers.
 ƘCommunity Infiltration  occurs if all four houses have been 
raided or if at least one raided house has accumulated seven or more 
evidence. All players are hanged except those who became successful 
informers. The informer who was most useful to the Society for the 
Reformation of Manners wins. Informers become useful by ensuring 
the right suit of evidence is gathered and by keeping a low profile.
 ƘCommunity Survival  occurs if the community joy marker has 
equaled or surpassed the threshold corresponding to the number 
of players as indicated on the joy track (e.g. 30 with four players). In 
that event, the player(s) with the most joy win(s). Though players 
will have to resolve indictments, the community has demonstrated its 
persistence and will continue to thrive despite persecution. 
 ƘCommunity Atrophy occurs if neither of the above conditions 
has been met by the end of the game’s fifth week. All players lose. 
This ending represents the erosion of the molly houses: although the 
Society failed to persecute the mollies, their culture failed to become 
self-sustaining.
All these  
things match.

Your Turn
Roll the two movement dice and resolve market discard(s). For each market 
discard icon you roll, take the card from the market that is farthest from the 
vice deck and add it to the safe pile. If it is a molly or threat card, add it to the 
gossip pile instead. Remember that the safe pile can be freely inspected while cards in 
the gossip pile are always face down. 
 M The Most Infamous is Exposed. Whenever a threat from the market 
is added to the gossip pile, the most infamous player is exposed. To 
determine the most infamous player, each player adds up the numerical 
value of cards in their reputation matching the threat (with mollies 
being treated as tens). The player with the highest sum is the most 
infamous. If there is a tie, all tied players are exposed. If none of the 
players have a matching card in their reputations, no player is exposed. 
Next, move your pawn. Count the number of boot icons on exactly one 
or both of the dice you rolled. Move your pawn that exact number of sites 
along the board, without backtracking. If one of the dice rolled was a market 
discard (no boots), you may remain at the same site. If you rolled two market 
discards, you may choose to be picked up by a fancy fellow in a carriage and 
place your pawn on any site. 
Then, you must take one action. You always have access to the three basic 
actions and your site’s action. Actions are described below.
Finally, refill the market and check hand size. Shift the remaining cards in 
the market down to fill any empty spaces, and refill the market from the vice 
deck, if possible. If your hand has more than 6 cards, add the excess to the 
gossip pile. Threats will not expose players if added to gossip in this way.
Play then continues with the next player clockwise. If the vice deck is empty, the 
next clockwise player will resolve the End of the Week phases before taking their turn. 
Basic Actions
These actions can be taken on any site so long as the action’s requirement is 
met. For instance, you can indulge only if there is a market card matching your site.
Lie Low
Draw the top card of the vice deck and add it to your hand. 
Indulge
Select a card in the market matching the suit of your current site and add 
it to your hand. You cannot take this action if you are at one of the four shop 
sites, since they do not match any suit. 
Accuse
If another player is at your site, you may reveal one of their placed 
encounter tokens (these tokens are often placed during the End of the Week). 
Note that while their pawn must be at your site, the encounter token you 
reveal may be at any house, so long as it has not yet been revealed. 
If it shows loyal, lower your joy by three spaces. 
If it shows an informer, score three joy and then advance the communi-
ty joy marker by the same amount. The accused player is now a revealed 
informer (see page 14).

Site Actions
These actions can only be taken if your pawn is at the corresponding site. If a 
molly house has been raided, players may not Throw a Festivity at that site. 
Many molly houses were public coffee shops or boarding houses that offered access to the 
molly community for trusted patrons. In the game, it is assumed that all players have 
already earned the trust necessary to enter these communities.
Cruise 
The cruising sites are adjacent to each molly house. While there, take one 
desire card (not a threat or a molly) that matches the site from your hand and 
add it to your reputation. If you already have a molly in your reputation matching 
the card you cruised with, remember to score the bonus!
Next, draw cards from the vice deck equal to your reputation in the site’s suit, 
but no more than four. If there are not enough cards in the deck, take a draw 
token for each card that you could not draw. You cannot take this action if you do 
not add a desire to your reputation, even if you have a reputation with this site’s suit!
 M Dangerous Cruising. After a molly house has been raided, cruising 
becomes more dangerous at its adjacent sites. After playing a card and 
drawing cards (and scoring any molly bonuses), you must add the card 
you just played to the gossip pile and gain one matching cube. 
Shop
The shop sites are located at the mid-point along each edge 
of the board. While there, take the item from the site 
and place it, face up, on your one of your player 
board’s item slots. If you already have two 
items, you must discard either the item just 
taken or one of your other two. The 
powers of items are described on 
page 16. Note that you do not refill the 
shop; new items will be placed during 
the End of the Week phase.
Finally, perform a market dis-
card as described on the pre-
vious page (adding the farthest 
card from the vice deck to the safe 
pile if the card is a desire, to the 
gossip pile if it is a molly, or to the 
gossip pile and resolving exposure 
if it was a threat). 
CRUISE ACTION
Pink takes the cruise action at  
St Paul’s Cathedral and plays a desire of 
pentacles to their reputation. Because 
they have five matching reputation 
(including card just played), they draw 
four cards, the maximum allowed.

Throw a Festivity 
This action offers players their primary way of scoring joy. It can be taken at 
one of the four corners of the board, so as long as that house has not been 
raided. Unlike other actions, this action is resolved over a number of phases, 
which are described below. You must have at least two cards in your hand to 
take this action (or three if playing with just two players).
 M Running Out of Cards. During a festivity the vice deck will sometimes 
run out of cards. If a player has to draw a card and there are no cards 
remaining, they instead gain a draw token for each. Any timing issues 
around drawing are decided clockwise, runner first. If the community 
has to play a card, shuffle the gossip pile and draw from that. 
First, bring the party to order.
To indicate that a party is about to begin, take the candelabra and place it in 
front of you. You are the festivity runner. 
Second, play cards. 
Cards are played over two rounds (or over three rounds in a game with two 
players). At the start of each round, reveal the top card of the vice deck and 
place it in the center of the board; it is considered to have been played by the 
community. Then players each take a turn, starting with the runner and pro-
ceeding clockwise. 
When it is a player’s turn, they must either pass or play:
 ƘIf they pass, their turn is skipped for the remainder of the festivity. 
 ƘIf they play, they place any card from their hand on the table in front 
of them. The festivity runner must play a card each round.
 M Rogues are Fickle. If a player plays a rogue, they must set its value to 
any number from zero to nine, indicating the value with a ten-sided 
die. This card will act as a desire of that value when determining 
the festivity rank. If the community plays a rogue, determine its 
value randomly by rolling a ten-sided die. A rogue may take a value, 
such as zero, that is not otherwise in the game. 
Third, determine and score the festivity.
After all rounds have been played, the best set of four cards is selected to be 
scored from among those played, using the following ranking:
1st Surprise Ball: Four desire cards of the same suit in sequential order. 
2nd Christening: Queen and 3 desire cards of the same value. 
3rd Dance: Jack and 3 desire cards in sequential order (ignore suit). 
If multiple sets of the same rank could be made, the set containing the desire 
with the highest value is selected. If the winning set could be made multiple 
ways (e.g. with a rogue instead of a desire of the same value), the festivity runner 
decides which specific cards will be selected.
If no set of the above ranks can be made, a Quiet Gathering occurs. The 
four lowest desires are selected as the winning set, ignoring rogues. If there 
were fewer than four desires played, score only those.
 M Constables are Intimidating. During Quiet Gatherings, treat 
constables as zero-value desires. This means constables will always be 
selected during a Quiet Gathering.

Then, each selected card is added to the reputation of the player who played 
it and is scored. Each card scores its player as much joy as indicated by its 
stars (or lack thereof) and may trigger molly bonuses (see page 7).
If a community card was selected, advance the community joy marker by the 
amount indicated, then add the card to the safe pile. If the community played 
a molly card that was selected, count it as having four stars. Remember that 
mollies do not have regular joy values, so players never score this.
Foiling a Threat
Scoring a threat at a festivity represents a successful effort to outfox the Society 
and protect one’s own reputation and the wider community. 
If a threat card is part of the selected set, add it to the safe pile instead 
after all other cards have been resolved. The player who played the card 
then adds all matching cards in their reputation to the safe pile. If a 
threat played by the community was selected, all players do this.
 M The Pride Rule. Any player who adds cards to the safe pile at this time 
may take a matching cube for each card added to the safe pile. They 
may not do this partially: it is all or nothing. Decide any timing issues 
in turn order (clockwise starting with candelabra). 
If multiple threats are selected as part of the same festivity, the party 
runner decides the order in which they are foiled. 
Fourth, generate gossip.
The festivity runner then adds the remaining cards on the table to the gossip 
pile, one at a time. Each time a card is added to the gossip pile, the player who 
played it draws one card from the vice deck. No cards are drawn to replace 
those played by the community. Remember: if the vice deck runs out of cards, play-
ers gain draw tokens instead. 
 M The Party-goer is Exposed. If a player played a threat that was added 
to the gossip pile, that player is exposed (page 6).
 M The Community is Exposed. If the community played a threat that 
was added to the gossip pile, all players are exposed (page 6).
Fifth, score the runner’s bonus and the community’s bonus.
If a Surprise Ball, Christening, or Dance occurred, the festivity runner scores 
joy equal to their reputation matching their pawn’s site. If a Quiet Gathering 
occurred, the runner loses this amount of joy instead. Then the community joy 
marker is advanced +3/+2/+1/-1 if a Surprise Ball/Christening/Dance/Quiet 
Gathering occurred. Joy cannot go below zero.
An extended festivity example 
can be found on page 17.

End of the Week
If the vice deck is empty at the start of your turn, take the candelabra and resolve 
the phases described in this section. 
Reveal Threats
Each player must reveal all threat cards in their hand and add them to the gossip 
pile (for revealed informers, see page 14). Any player who reveals one or more 
threat cards gains a single draw token.
 M The Hesitant Players are Exposed. Each time a player adds a threat to 
the gossip pile, they are exposed.
Note on verification: if playing the game in a tournament setting (or if you are bothered by 
the possibility of cheating), have a third party quickly check the hands of players to ensure 
that there are no undisclosed threats that would otherwise need to be revealed now.
The Society Investigates
Each week the Society for the Reformation of Manners gathers to review the evi-
dence it has obtained from its many spies. During this phase the Society may raid 
houses and undermine the community.
First, prepare the gossip pile.
Shuffle the gossip pile. Add one third of the 
cards to the safe pile, rounding down. Reveal 
the remainder. 
Second, gather evidence.
Examine the revealed cards. Each threat gener-
ates one matching evidence for each matching 
desire or molly. Place this evidence on the 
matching molly houses.
Third, check for raids.
If an open molly house has seven or more 
evidence, it is raided! Place a “House Raided” 
token on that site and a “Dangerous Cruising” 
token at the two adjacent sites. Then return 
seven evidence from that house to the supply, 
leaving any remainder. 
When a house is raided, the player(s) with the 
most reputation in the matching house gain(s) 
a major indictment. The player(s) with the 
second most reputation in the matching house 
gain(s) a minor indictment. In the case of ties, 
all tied players receive the same type of indict-
ment. This means that if there are three players tied 
for first and two players tied for second, the three 
players will each get major indictments and the two players will both get minor indict-
ments. Players with no reputation matching the raided house are not considered. 
Any indictments gained should be placed, face down, below their player’s board. 
Players may inspect their indictments at any time. There is no limit to the number 
of indictments a player may have. 
In the very unlikely case that a stack of indictments cards runs out, no cards of 
that type are gained. Instead, any players who would have gained that indictment 
lower their joy by four for a minor indictment and eight for a major indictment. 
Joy cannot fall below zero. 
EXAMINING GOSSIP
The gossip pile has 11 cards in it. Three are 
discarded. The remaining eight are revealed. 
The following evidence is generated: 
The cups evidence is placed on Julius 
Cesar Taylor’s and fans evidence 
is placed on Miss Muff’s.

Fourth, check for game end.
Then, check to see if the game has ended.
 ƘIf all four houses have been raided or a raided house has accumulated 
seven or more evidence, the game ends with Community Infiltration. 
 ƘOtherwise, if the community joy marker has reached or exceeded 
the game end threshold for your player count, the game ends with 
Community Survival. 
 ƘIf neither of these conditions has been met and the fifth week has been 
completed, the game ends with Community Atrophy. 
If the game ends, skip any remaining phases in the End of the Week and re-
solve final scoring. Scoring for the different endings is described on page 18.
Encounter the Society
Simultaneously, all players who gained indictment cards this week must select 
one of their encounter tokens and place it, face down, on the nearest open 
molly house to that player’s pawn (going clockwise if tied). Encounter tokens 
are considered to match the suit of the molly house where they are placed. 
Players may inspect their own encounter tokens at any time. It is possible for 
the same player to have multiple encounter tokens on a single house. 
If a player has one or no encounter tokens, they may skip this phase. 
Cleanup
Perform the following steps to prepare for the next week.
1. Shuffle all vice cards except those in players’ hands, players’ reputations, 
and the market. This deck of cards becomes the vice deck. 
2. Deal one card to the gossip pile face down and refill any vacant market 
spaces with face up cards from the vice deck.
3. Starting with the player with the candelabra and proceeding clockwise, 
each player draws one card for each of their draw tokens, then returns 
those tokens to the supply.
4. Discard any item cards on shops and then deal one new item, face up, to 
each shop site. If the item deck is empty, shuffle the discarded items to 
form a new item deck.
5. Finally, advance the current week marker to the next week. Play now 
resumes with the player with the candelabra.

Betraying the Mollies
Historically, the molly houses were brought down by a network of informers who were 
coerced into helping the Society for the Reformation of Manners.
Players often become informers by playing their informer encounter token 
during the Encounter the Society phase (see previous page). 
An informer succeeds if the house where they placed their informer token has 
been raided by the end of the game. There are two potential benefits to being 
a successful informer:
 ƘIndictments Pardoned. If the game ends with Community Survival, 
successful informers discard all of their indictments.
 ƘAnother Path to Victory. If the game ends with Community Infiltration, 
successful informers are not hanged. Instead, they will score victory 
points (not joy!) based on their performance as an informer. Their 
scoring is described on the next page.
However, being an informer is not without risk! An unsuccessful informer will 
gain an additional major indictment if the community survives. 
Revealed Informers
If a player’s informer token is revealed during the game, they become 
a revealed informer. They must immediately add all cards in their 
reputation that match their informer token to the safe pile. 
In addition, they must follow the benefits and restrictions listed 
below.
A Social Pariah
Revealed informer must add any cards in excess of their 
hand size to the safe pile (instead of the gossip pile) at the 
end of their turns.
A Known Threat
After sets are determined and scored at festivities, any cards 
in a revealed informer’s reputation matching their informer 
token are added to the safe pile. Note that this happens 
before threats that failed to score expose player(s)! 
At the end of the week, they do not reveal threats matching 
their informer token. 
Unwelcome near the Molly House
Revealed informers can no longer take the Throw a Festivity action at the 
molly house matching their informer token or the Cruise action at the adja-
cent sites. If a festivity occurs at that molly house on another player’s turn, 
they must pass and the community then plays an additional card. They also 
cannot play items at festivities at that house. 
A Rush to Resolution
If all players are revealed informers in the last open house, the week ends 
immediately and should be treated as if it is the fifth week. This rule allows the 
game to end at the moment when players no longer have a way to meaningful contest 
victory. This should be a very rare situation. 

--- Page 15 ---

Game End and Victory
If the game end is triggered, follow the corresponding resolution below.
Community Infiltration
All players reveal their encounter tokens.
Players without informer tokens and those with an 
informer token matching an open house are found 
guilty of sodomy and hanged; flip their joy marker 
over to its hanged side. 
Players with an informer token matching a raided 
house are not hanged. Instead, they set their joy to 
zero. 
Each of these informers will now tally their score. 
They score two victory points per evidence at the 
house with their informer token, plus two victory 
points for each reputation point of all other players 
that matches that house. They then will subtract 
one point for their own reputation in all suits. This 
includes the suit they informed against! Successful in-
formers may wish to tally their score on the joy 
track, but some groups may find it in poor taste.
The game is now over, and the player with 
the highest positive number of victory 
points wins. If any players are tied for 
the highest score or no player has a score 
greater than zero, all lose.
Community Survival
All players reveal their indictments and 
encounter tokens on the board.
Pardon successful informers. If a player’s informer token is at a raided house, 
they have successfully collaborated with the Society. That player discards all 
of their indictments. Then, any played loyal tokens belonging to that player 
are discarded.
Prosecute failed informers. If a player’s informer token matches an open 
house, their failure to collaborate is punished by the Society. That player gains 
one major indictment card. 
Score loyal tokens. Each player scores 2 joy for each of their loyal tokens at 
an open house. 
Finally, in turn order, each player with at least one indictment must face a 
trial, resolving each of their indictment cards in any order as follows: Roll a 
ten-sided die and lower their joy by the amount indicated on the card for that 
die result. If the amount shows a noose icon, the player has been hanged and 
must flip their joy marker. 
The game is now over, and the player with the highest joy who hasn’t been 
hanged wins. If there is a tie, tied players share the victory. 
Community Atrophy
All players lose. 
INFORMER SCORING EXAMPLE
The game has ended with Community Infiltration. 
Though raided, there are no cubes on Julius Cesar 
Taylor’s molly house (cups). Yellow has revealed 
their informer token on that house. Red’s reputation 
is seven cups. Blue’s is two cups. Yellow’s is five 
cups and two hearts. Yellow’s final score will be 
11. They get 18 for Red’s and Blue’s reputations 
[(7+2)×2], but deduct seven for their own reputation.

Item Powers 
Players may have up to two items stored in the slots on their player board. These items do 
not count as part of a player’s reputation. 
When players use an item, they should resolve its effect and then discard it. 
Items use a variety of timing windows. Molly House is not a real-time game, and players 
should allow one another a little grace if a timing window is narrowly missed. Any timing 
conflicts should be resolved clockwise, starting with the player with the candelabra. 
Bottle of Gin
Play after the last card of a festivity is played but before the winning set is 
selected. All players—even those who passed—play an additional round. 
Do not play an additional card for the community. Players, including the 
runner, may pass during this additional round. 
Revealed informers who were previously barred from playing may play 
during this round as if the festivity were at another house. 
Bribe
Play on your turn instead of taking an action. Examine the gossip 
pile and secretly add one card of your choice to your hand. 
Domino
Play before revealing gossip during the Society Investigates phase. 
Your reputation is ignored if any houses are raided. For example, even if 
you have most reputation in a specific house (and would have taken a major 
indictment), you will take no indictment, and other players may receive the 
major and minor indictments instead. 
Dress
After you play a card during a festivity, you may also play the dress item 
in the matching suit. The requirement for a Surprise Ball for this festivity is 
now four desires of this suit rather than its usual requirement of four sequen-
tial cards of any one suit. As usual, if there are more than four cards played of 
that suit, the highest are selected. Remember too that rogues count as desires. 
If multiple dresses are played, multiple suits may be used to build a 
Surprise Ball. For instance, if the cups and hearts dresses are both played, a 
Surprise Ball could be formed with one cups and three hearts.
Any played dresses are discarded at the end of the festivity, even if the set 
was not a Surprise Ball.
Newspaper Notice
Play on your turn instead of taking an action if your pawn is at an open 
molly house. Place one of your encounter tokens, face up, at this site. Add 
all matching cards in the market to the gossip pile, scoring 2 joy for each 
card if you placed a loyal encounter token. Any threats are resolved as if added to gossip 
by a market discard. Players often use Newspaper notices to become informers, and, as they play 
their informer token face up, they become revealed informers immediately. 
Violin
Play at any time during a festivity before the set is selected. Draw an addi-
tional two cards for the community. If the vice deck is empty, shuffle and 
draw from the gossip pile.

Determine and Score Festivity
Blue must select the Jack, 4, 5, and 6, which makes a Dance. The 
community scores 4 joy and discards the Jack. Blue scores 3 joy and Purple 
scores 10 joy (7 for the played cards and 3 for the molly bonus of the queen in 
their reputation). Players add the cards they score to their reputations. 
Round One
The community plays a Jack. 
Blue wants to build off 
the Jack, so opts for a 4, 
hoping for a Dance. 
Yellow has no interest 
and plays a 2, hoping for 
a Quiet Gathering.
Purple likes where Blue is going 
and joins the Dance with a 5. 
Round Two
The community plays a Constable.
That constable scares Blue, who 
has a considerable reputation 
in pentacles. They opt to play 
a low value card, now hoping 
for a Quiet Gathering.
Yellow plays another 
low value card.
Purple thankfully has a 6, so 
the dance is successful.
The Festivity’s Context
Blue heads to Mother Clap’s for a festivity. The reputations of all players are shown below. Note that 
Blue has a reputation of two in pentacles, so as long as a Quiet Gathering doesn’t take place, they 
are likely to score at least two joy for their runner’s bonus because Mother Clap’s suit is pentacles. 
Pawns and markers are pictured only to 
indicate seating order and card ownership.
Generate Gossip
The remaining cards are added to the gossip pile. Blue draws 
one card from the deck and Yellow draws two. Because a threat 
played by the community was not scored, all players are exposed 
by it: gaining cubes for any pentacles cards in their reputations 
(including those just added!) and adding those cards to the gossip 
pile. Purple gains one pentacles cube, Blue gains two.
Score Community and Runner Bonuses
Finally, Blue scores two joy as their runner’s bonus (for their 
reputation at this house) and the community scores one joy (for 
the Dance). Note that even though the failure to score the pentacles 
constable forced Blue to move the pentacles cards in their reputation to 
gossip, the cards were replaced by cubes so their reputation is unchanged.

Design History & Dedication
Molly House was conceived in response to the announcement of the inaugu-
ral Zenobia Award in late 2020. I was a musician who hadn’t played a gig in 
months and needed somewhere to put that energy, and working on a game 
was something I’d certainly thought about but never pursued in earnest. I was 
aware of molly houses, thanks to the title of a piece written by my composi-
tion tutor, Michael Finnissy, and as I researched further, a game concept came 
into being.
After a brief time as a head-to-head game of mollies versus constables, the con-
cept developed into more or less what you find now: playing as mollies risking 
imprisonment and even their lives in the pursuit of queer joy, or being coerced 
into betraying the community for their own survival. Over the course of the 
Zenobia Award process, it morphed from a simple push-your-luck card game 
to a much larger euro, but even though the game functioned and was saying 
all the right things, I still knew it could be vastly improved.
When the Zenobia Award ended, Cole, who had been my assigned mentor, 
reached out with a tentative offer to work towards publication. I accepted. 
Then ensued several months of Cole, Drew and me passing the design back 
and forth, making radical mechanical alterations, always in pursuit of the 
original vision of the game.
The biggest problems we were trying to solve were how to make the players, 
together with the non-player mollies represented in the game, feel like a living 
community, and how to make the festivities truly feel like parties in how they 
play. It took years of collaborative effort to come up with the solutions present 
in the game today.
I am forever indebted to endlessly patient friends, family, collaborators, Zeno-
bia Award volunteers and many strangers who have invested time and effort 
into this project. I dedicate this game to all mollies, past, present and future, 
who blaze the trail for those who come after them.

On Presentation and Identity
While it’s tempting to project our own ideas 
onto the past, we have tried our best to meet 
the mollies on their own terms when present-
ing them in this game. For that reason, where 
possible, we have used their “maiden names,” 
as these are how they would have referred 
to each other within the community. We can 
speculate on whether these were aliases used 
to hide legal names, something akin to drag 
personas, a representation of their true identi-
ties, or some combination of all of these, but 
we can never be truly sure.
There is not much recorded dialogue from 
within the community, so the question of pro-
nouns is hard to answer. There is certainly evi-
dence that some mollies often or always took 
on female personas and referred to each other 
as “she.” Whether this is similar to queer 
men’s modern custom of calling each other 
“she,” a way to indicate a trans-like identity, 
both, or neither, we can only speculate upon.
Molly Biographies
Historical Note: Some of these biographies mention the crime of “assault with intent to 
commit sodomy.” This does not imply lack of consent. Two people could be indicted for 
“assaulting” each other for engaging in consensual sex.
Flying Horse Moll
Mentioned as one of 40 misbehaving “men in 
women’s clothes” apprehended after a private 
masquerade in January 1725 who “generally go 
amongst themselves by Female Names or rather 
by the Names of the Racers at Newmarket” (the 
famous racetrack in Suffolk). Also mentioned in 
Julius Cesar Taylor’s trial and in a list of names of 
mollies given in notorious robber James Dalton’s 
confession.
Orange Deb
Indicted under the legal name Martin Mackin-
tosh in July 1726 for assaulting Joseph Sellers 
with intent to commit sodomy. Sellers was one 
of the Society for the Reformation of Manners’ 
constables and was admitted entrance to a molly 
house in Drury Lane by posing as the husband 
of informer Mark Partridge. Orange Deb was 
sentenced to pillory, a 10 Mark fine and a year in 
prison.

--- Page 20 ---

Prety Criss
One of the list of molly names given by James 
Dalton, Prety Criss is described only as ‘a Soldier 
of the 2nd Regiment’. Criss is far from the only 
name on the list where this is the case. I have 
found no further information about many of the 
mollies listed, including Small Coal Mary, Tub 
Nan, Sukey Pisquill, Hardward Nan and Thumbs 
and Waste Jenny.
Queen Irons
Sukey Haws, a molly and member of James 
Dalton’s gang, recounted stories from the molly 
houses to Dalton, which he repeated in his con-
fession. He gave the story of a wedding between 
Queen Irons and another molly, with Miss Kitten 
and Princess Seraphina as bridesmaids. A newspa-
per from October 1726 reported on Queen Irons’ 
conviction for assault with attempt to commit 
sodomy, with a sentence of pillory, a fine and three 
months’ imprisonment.
Princess Seraphina
Perhaps the most well-documented molly from 
the time. Although mentioned in the Old Bailey 
Proceedings, she was not the one on trial. She 
brought a case against one Thomas Gordon for 
allegedly stealing her clothes. She called several 
character witnesses, many of whom appeared not 
to be part of the molly community, but still re-
ferred to her as “she” and “her” and “never heard 
that she had any other Name than the Princess 
Seraphina.” She was described as very feminine, 
often wearing dresses and attending masquerades, 
and it was well known and seemingly accepted 
among her neighbors that she had relations with 
men.

Susan Guzzle
Mentioned in James Dalton’s 1728 confession as 
the midwife at a “lying-in,” a mock birthing cere-
mony in which a molly would sit in a chair, attend-
ed by others with napkins and a basin of water, 
and act out giving birth to a wooden doll. Similar 
scenes are described in Ned Ward’s Satirical Re-
flections on Clubs from 1709 and robber Thomas 
Neaves’ 1728 confession. Randolph Trumbach 
has theorized this may have its origins in a rural 
tradition, citing a “mock groaning” from a small 
Gloucestershire village in 1716 in which a “sod-
omite” was dressed in a mantua and feigned giving 
birth to a wad of straw in baby’s clothes.
Miss Kitten
The bridesmaid from Queen Irons’ wedding was 
convicted of extortion under the legal name James 
Oviat in February 1728. Miss Kitten threatened 
to swear sodomy against Rodolphus Blank after 
an apparent cruising attempt in St James’s Park. 
Miss Kitten got a guinea out of it, but when Blank 
refused to pay any more, Miss Kitten fetched a 
constable, which backfired when other prisoners 
recognized Kitten and resulted in a sentence of 
pillory, a fine and prison.
Aunt England
James Dalton named Aunt England as a “noted 
soap boiler” and a steward at Sukey Bevell’s molly 
house, and also as a standing gossip at a lying-in 
in which Aunt Grear was “brought to bed of a 
Cheshire cheese.” No further information is avail-
able about Aunt England or Sukey Bevell, which 
suggests maiden names may sometimes have 
functioned to avoid the discovery of mollies’ legal 
names, thereby protecting their identities.

Molly House Owners
Julius Cesar Taylor
A Black molly who ran a molly house where the christening ceremony is 
known to have occurred, in which mollies were given a maiden name by 
having gin thrown in their face. Julius Cesar Taylor was found guilty of both 
assault and keeping a disorderly house, but was sentenced only to a fine and 
was required to find a surety to ensure his ongoing good behavior (this was 
essentially a sponsor who could guarantee a bond of some amount).
Sukey Bevell
Sukey Bevell’s molly house is mentioned in James Dalton’s narrative as a 
place of extravagance in The Mint (a district in Southwark) and the location 
of Queen Irons’ wedding, but no further information is given elsewhere. There 
is no record of it having been raided.
Constables & Rogues
The Society for the Reformation of Manners was a 
group active in the late 17th and early 18th century, set 
up with the aim to enforce laws against behavior its 
members deemed immoral, including sex work, Sab-
bath breaking, swearing and sodomy. To achieve this, 
they paid agents to find information and apprehend 
perpetrators of these crimes, essentially forming one 
of the first proto-police forces in London.
Samuel Stevens, William Davison, Thomas Willis and 
Joseph Sellers were agents of the Society for the Ref-
ormation of Manners. They gathered evidence against 
mollies by staking out cruising spots and infiltrating 
molly houses and recruited informers from within the 
molly community to help them achieve this.
According to Randolph Trumbach, the government 
took over these cases in early 1726, and with the help 
of the Society’s evidence, 56 mollies were charged or 
arrested for crimes relating to sodomy in that year.

Mother Clap
Margaret “Mother” Clap was a cis woman who ran a molly house at a coffee 
house owned by her husband, which was reported to regularly have 40 attend-
ees. Her molly house was raided in 1725, leading to two death sentences and 
Clap being convicted of a crime tantamount to keeping a brothel. Her sen-
tence of pillory and prison is believed to have led to her death.
Miss Muff
Miss Muff’s molly house was raided by Thomas Willis and accomplices in 
October 1728. They apprehended the lady of the house along with “nine male 
Ladies,” based on information given by Jonathan Parrey. According to the 
papers, Miss Muff was committed to Newgate for a misdemeanor.
The rogues of Molly House take their names from informers who gave the constables access to the 
molly community, ultimately resulting in several molly house raids, many incarcerations and a 
handful of death sentences.
Ned Courtney
A young molly who gave evidence against George Keger and George Whytle, 
the former of whom was sentenced to death but later reprieved, and the latter 
acquitted by a jury.
Mark Partridge
The most prolific informer of the time, who gave evidence against twelve 
molly house owners and sixteen other mollies. Reportedly betrayed the 
mollies out of revenge against an ex-lover named Harrington, who 
doesn’t appear to have been caught.
Thomas Newton
Gave evidence against three attendees at molly houses, including Mother 
Clap’s, resulting in three death sentences. The guilty parties were hanged 
at Tyburn in May 1726.
Jonathan Parrey
Gave evidence against three attendees at Miss Muff’s molly house, includ-
ing John Bleak Cowland, who claimed to attend only to learn the violin, 
but was found guilty and sentenced to death, though later reprieved.

Reading queer Georgians
Queer history is a relatively new field, formed from incomplete fragments that 
are rarely written by queer people themselves. However, there is a relative 
wealth of primary sources on mollies and their communities due to their polic-
ing by The Society for the Reformation of Manners and the police forces that 
were established in the Society’s wake. These are readily accessible in The Pro-
ceedings of the Old Bailey, which have been scanned, digitized and catalogued 
online. A search for records related to the crime of “Sodomy,” “Assault with 
sodomitical intent,” or “Keeping a brothel” will bring you the trial records of 
many of the people included in this game.
While not exclusively about molly houses, Rictor Norton’s Mother Clap’s Molly 
House (1992) is the only full-length history book on the topic that I’m aware 
of. Although still a valuable read, it’s certainly showing its age, and is posi-
tively misogynistic and transphobic in places. Its insistence that the history 
of molly houses is the history of gay men exclusively, and does not include 
people we might think of as trans and queer today, is a strange anachronism 
that fails to meet the mollies on their own terms. However, Norton’s online 
sourcebook, Homosexuality in Eighteenth-Century England, is an invaluable ar-
chive of digitized primary sources, including contemporary newspaper articles 
and chapters from books not so easily accessible.
For a broader and more extensive history of gender and sexuality in the 18th 
century, see the work of Randolph Trumbach, including his chapter in Queer 
Sites: Gay Urban Histories Since 1600 (1999) and his book Sex and the Gender 
Revolution: Volume One. Heterosexuality and the Third Gender in Enlightenment 
London (1998). A second volume, dedicated to homosexuality, is apparently 
in the works. Further exploration of Georgian attitudes about gender and 
identity can be found in Dror Wahrman’s The Making of the Modern Self (2007), 
which gave me a lot more confidence in the ways we chose to depict and refer 
to mollies within the game.
Even learning how to do queer history was an important part of this process. 
Chris Roulston’s “New Approaches to the Queer 18th Century” in Literature 
Compass, vol. 10, no. 10 (2013), and its references to the works of Valerie Traub, 
Laura Doan, Madhavi Menon and many others introduced me to the concepts 
of “unhistoricism,” looking for the “unheard of,” and “queering history” as a 
verb, all of which were important tools in our attempt to approach this game 
correctly.
