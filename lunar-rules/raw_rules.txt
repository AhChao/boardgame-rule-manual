SETUP 
Lunar can be played with 2 or 4 players.
4 Players: Break up into teams of 2 and seat partners across 
from each other. Each team takes 2 matching-
color partnership tiles, and each teammate 
chooses 1 to place in front of themselves.
2 Players: Each player takes a partnership tile that says 
“lead.”
Place the trick track near the play area. Each team (or individual) 
chooses a trick marker and places it on 0. The player with the 
black lead tile is the first start player.

DEAL
The following rules are for playing in teams. Two-
player rules are on pg. 4.
Each round, shuffle the rank cards and suit cards 
separately, then deal 6 rank cards and 6 suit 
cards to each player. Each player simultaneously 
chooses 2 ranks and 2 suits from their hand. 
Then, each player passes their chosen cards to 
their partner.
Next, choose the trump suit for the round. Flip 
the 4 trump tiles face up. Beginning with the 
start player and going clockwise, each player 
flips 1 tile of their choice face down, until only 1 is 
left face up. This is the trump suit for the round.
TRICKS
The start player leads the first trick by playing 
any 1 card from their hand. Going clockwise 
around the table, each other player must play 1 
card into the trick.
If you are the first player on your team to play this 
trick, you may play either a suit or a rank card. If 
your partner has played, you must play the card 
type your partner did not play (suit or rank).  
The first time a suit is played into a trick, it 
becomes the lead suit. If you play a suit at 
any time after the lead suit has already been 
decided, you must play the same suit, if you 
have it. If you don’t, you may play any suit.

When everyone has played a card, the trick 
winner is decided as follows:
• If the teams played the same suit, the 
team that played the higher rank wins. If 
tied, the last team to play a card wins.
• If one team played trump suit and the 
other did not, the team that played trump 
wins.
• If the teams played different suits and 
neither was trump suit, the team that 
played the first suit wins. 
Advance the winning team’s marker 1 space 
on the trick track. If the trick includes any 
cards with a        icon, the winning team 
keeps them. Discard all other cards played. 
The player who has the lead tile on the team 
that won the previous trick leads the next 
trick.
ROUND END
When players run out of cards, each team 
scores points equal to the       next to their 
position on the trick track, plus 1 point for 
each       on their kept cards. Record these 
scores on the scoreboard.
If a team has more than 30 points and the 
teams are not tied, the team with the most 
points wins the game. Otherwise, pass all 4 
partnership tiles clockwise and start a new 
round. The player with the lead tile on the

team with fewer points becomes start player.
If tied, black lead tile is the start player. If both 
teams exceed 30 points and are tied, play a 
final round to determine the winner.
2-PLAYER GAME
Deal each player 6 ranks and 6 suits as normal. 
Then reveal 3 ranks and 3 suits from the decks 
to form the sky. Do not pass any cards.
When choosing trump, the player with the 
black lead tile flips the first tile, then players 
alternate flipping tiles until there is 1 left. (This 
means the starting player will flip 2 tiles total, 
but their opponent will only flip 1.)
During each trick, players take 2 turns each. 
You must use one of your turns to play 1 card 
from your hand, and the other to play 1 card 
from the sky (in either order). One card you 
play must be a rank, and the other must be a 
suit. At the end of the trick, refill the sky from 
the deck.
As in team games, once a lead suit has been 
decided, the other player must play the same 
suit if able. However, when determining if 
you can play the lead suit, you only consider 
the cards in the area you choose to play from 
(either your hand or the sky). For example, if 
your opponent leads a suit, and the same suit is 
in your hand but not the sky, you could choose 
to play a different suit from the sky.
