Nature is bursting with life!
Earth is home to millions of species - plants, fungi, insects, birds, reptiles, and mammals - each with an 
innate drive to grow and flourish.
The game of Nature simulates a dynamic ecosystem around a small watering hole. The goal is to grow your 
population while navigating two threats: starvation and predation. Strategically adapt to the changing 
environment and your species will flourish and thrive, but adapt poorly and your population will dwindle. 
There are thousands of unique species to discover.
Welcome to the incredible diversity of Nature!

Population
The goal of Nature is to have a flourishing population. Population 
  represents animals that need 
to be fed and protected. 
Food 
Every population
 needs food. There are two types of food: plant 
  and meat 
  . Each 
food that sustains a population 
  for a round will be worth 1 point at the end of the game.
Player Screens
Place your food 
 /
  behind your player screen at the end of each round. This keeps the score 
hidden until the end of the game. 
Watering Hole
The watering hole is the only place for animals to eat plants 
 . A limited number of plants 
  
are added each round, so get to the watering hole before the food runs out!
Hunter Cards
Any player can use a hunter card to turn their species into a hunter. A hunter no longer eats plants
 from the watering hole. Instead, it eats meat 
  by hunting animals around the watering hole.
Size Dials
Every species has a size dial 
  to keep track of its size. Larger species eat more food when they 
feed at the watering hole, and are better defended against hunters.
Nature Cards
There are 8 different traits in the Nature deck. These traits are superpowers that allow your species 
to adapt to the changing environment as they struggle to survive and thrive. 
Snow Leopard 
One of the most awesome first player markers in evolutionary history.
Solo Cards 
These cards are only used when you play Nature Solo. Each card represents an opponent’s species 
with a unique personality.

Shuffle the Nature cards and place them face-down to form the Nature deck.
Place the Hunter cards near the watering hole.
Give a player screen to each player.
The person who can make the most amazing animal noise goes first. Give them the snow leopard.
A set amount of food will be added to the watering hole at the start of each round. Draw the top card of the 
Nature deck, then multiply the food number shown (in the bottom right corner) by the number of players. 
This is the amount of plants
  that will be added to the watering hole each round. Tuck the card under the 
watering hole to remind you how much food to add in future rounds.

GOAL
The goal of Nature is to adapt your species in an ever-changing ecosystem where food is scarce and predators 
lurk. You will receive 1 point for every population
 you keep alive each round. To track this, you will place the 
food eaten by your population
 behind your player screen at the end of each round. 
At the end of the game, you will score:
• 1 point for every plant 
  and every meat 
  behind your player screen.
• 2 points for each of your surviving species as a Game End Bonus.
GAME STRUCTURE
Nature is played over four rounds. In each round, go through the following steps:

1 . ADD FOOD
Add the number of plants 
  determined during setup (page 4) to the watering hole. These are in addition to 
any plants 
  that might be leftover from the previous round.
2 . NEW SPECIES
Every round, each player takes the following:
• A size dial 
  showing size 1
• A population 
  
The size dial 
  represents the physical size of the animals and the population 
  represents the number of 
animals that need to be fed each round. Place the size dial 
  forager side up to show that it takes the forage 
action when feeding. 
Lost Population
If you lost population 
   
  in the previous round, add all lost population 
  to your new species. For 
example, if 3 of your population 
  were killed in the previous round, your new species will start with 4 
population 
 .
Lost Size
If your species became extinct in the previous round, add their size to your new species.
For example, if a size 3 species went extinct, your new species will start at size 4. Or if you lost two size 1 
species in the previous round, your new species will start at size 3.
Lost size that would make a species larger than the largest number on the size dial are lost forever (size 4 in 
Nature and size 10 with the Jurassic module).
3 . DRAW CARDS
Each player draws 5 cards from the Nature deck. There is no maximum hand size, so these 5 cards are in 
addition to cards that a player may have from a previous round. 
If you run out of cards in the Nature deck, shuffle the discard pile and make a new Nature draw deck. 
PREPARATION

--- Page 8 ---

The theme of the Adapting Phase takes place over millions of years as species adapt to the changing 
environment. Each player only gets one turn during this phase, so plan ahead! 
PLAY CARDS
The player with the snow leopard is the first player to take their turn. Each card in your hand can be used for 
the following actions: 
• Increase Population 
• Increase Size
• Play a Trait
On your turn, you may play as many cards as you like. Each action can be taken multiple times and in any order.
Increase Population
Take any card from your hand and place it face-up in the discard pile, then 
take a population 
  from the supply and add it to any one of your species. 
There is no limit to the number of population 
  a species can have.
Tip: The goal of Nature is to 
grow your population. You 
score points for keeping 
them alive each round.
ADAPTING PHASE

--- Page 9 ---
9
Increase Size
Take any card from your hand and place it face-up in the discard pile, then 
increase the size of any one of your species by rotating the size dial 
  to 
the next number. The maximum size on the Nature size dial 
  is 4, roughly 
the size of a rhinoceros, moose, or elephant.  
The size of a species determines how effective it is at hunting, defending, and foraging. These are explained in 
the Feeding Phase section (page 14 - 17). 
Play a Trait
Take any card from your hand and play it face-down above any one of your 
species. This card is now a trait that will modify that species once it is flipped 
face-up. The maximum number of traits a species can have is 3. You may play 
several of the same traits to a species, but each copy counts towards the 3 trait 
maximum.
Tip: A larger species eats 
more plants 
  when it 
forages from the watering 
hole, allowing it to eat the 
limited food before the 
other animals.
Tip: Every trait is 
powerful, but they are 
most powerful when 
combined with traits that 
synergize well.


--- Page 10 ---
10
FREE ACTIONS
Free actions allow you to adapt your species without playing a card from your hand. Free actions may be 
taken multiple times and at any time during your Adapting Phase turn.
Become a Hunter
You may play a Hunter card as a trait on any of your species. The Hunter trait counts toward the 3 trait limit. 
Each species can only have one Hunter trait.
When you play a Hunter trait, flip over the size dial
 of that species to show that it can hunt. It can 
no longer forage for plants 
  in the watering hole.
Remove Traits
You may discard traits from any of your species to make room for a different trait. Return Hunter traits to the 
Hunter deck and place other removed traits in the face-up discard pile. When you remove the Hunter card, 
flip your size dial 
  back to the forager side. It can no longer hunt other species. 
Hold Cards
You may keep 1 or more cards to play as food during the Feeding Phase, or 
to play in the next round.
REVEAL TRAITS
The Adapting Phase ends when every player has taken one turn. Flip all of the face-down traits so they are 
face-up and move into the Feeding Phase. 
Sam wants to make his species a hunter. He takes a Hunter card from the stack and adds it as 
his third trait. He then flips his size dial
 to show that his species is now a hunter.
Tip: Hold a card to add 
food to the watering hole 
if you think the food will 
be gone before your first 
feeding turn.

--- Page 11 ---
11
Traits are played on a species to modify the ability of that species. The rules on a trait card override the core 
Nature rules. A species can have a maximum of 3 traits.
HUNT VALUE AND DEFENSE VALUE
The hunt value 
  and defense value  of a species is equal to the number on its size dial 
 , but can be 
increased by trait cards.
In the top left of each trait, the value in the red tab adds to the species hunt value 
 , while the value in the grey 
tab adds to the defense value . If these tabs hold no values, nothing is added.

TRIGGER TRAITS
Traits with an exclamation point  are trigger traits. They have a mandatory ability that gets activated when 
the trigger condition is met. The ability will activate anytime the condition is met, regardless of whose turn it is. 
Scavenging triggers anytime a species hunts. It may trigger on your turn or someone else’s turn. When 
Scavenging triggers, the species eats 2 meat 
 .  
Opportunistic triggers on your turn, if there is plant 
  in the watering hole after one of your species forages 
or hunts. When Opportunistic triggers, the species eats  2 meat 
 .
Tusked triggers anytime the watering hole becomes empty. It may trigger on your turn or someone else’s turn.  
When Tusked triggers, the species eats 1 meat 
 .  
Lammergeier vultures will drop bones from hundreds of 
feet to break them and feed off the released marrow.

HERBIVORE
When a new species enters play at the start of the round, it is a Herbivore. It may eat plants 
 when it forages from the watering hole.
OMNIVORE
If a trigger trait is added to the species, it becomes an Omnivore. It may still forage to eat 
plants 
  from the watering hole, but it will also eat meat 
  if the trigger trait activates.
CARNIVORE
If a Hunter trait is added to the species, it becomes a Carnivore. It may no longer forage 
from the watering hole to eat plants 
 . It hunts to eat meat 
  instead.

This size 1 species has 2 population 
 , 
a Fast trait, a Plated trait, and a face-down 
trait. The face-down trait will get revealed 
at the end of the Adapting Phase. It has a 
defense value  of 5: 1 defense from its 
size +4 defense from Plated.
This size 2 species has 3 population 
 , 
a Social trait, and a Fast trait. It would 
normally eat 2 plants 
  when foraging 
from the watering hole because of its size, 
but because of Social, it will eat 4 plants 
. If this species was a hunter, Social would 
allow it to take 2 additional meat 
  from 
the supply when it hunts.
This size 3 species has 3 population 
 , 
a Hunter trait, and a Clawed trait. Its hunt 
value 
  is 5: 3 from its size and +2 from 
Clawed.

The Feeding Phase is a snapshot of the ecosystem at a specific point in time. Each player will get multiple turns 
during the Feeding Phase to feed their species.  
At the start of the Feeding Phase, every population 
  is hungry. Starting with the player who has the snow 
leopard and moving clockwise around the table, each player will take a feeding turn to feed one of their species. 
The Feeding Phase ends when every population 
  has been:
• fed ..................................................
 or
• killed by starvation ...................
• killed in a hunt ...........................
FEEDING ACTIONS
On your turn, you must take the first possible action out of the following:
1. Forage or hunt with one hungry species.
2. If you cannot forage or hunt; starve a hungry population.
3. If you cannot starve a hungry population, you must pass .
IMPORTANT DEFINITIONS
This is a hungry population; 
 . It does not have plant 
  or meat 
  on it.
These are fed population;
  /
 . 
When a population 
  is killed, flip it over; 
   
FEEDING PHASE

--- Page 15 ---
15
Foraging
When a species forages, it eats plants 
  from the watering hole equal to its size, plus any additional amount 
indicated by its traits. Place each eaten plant 
  on top of a hungry population 
 . 
A species must always eat the full amount unless:
• There are not enough plants 
  in the watering hole .
Plant food is limited to the number of plants 
  in the watering hole. If a species can forage for 4, but 
there are only 2 plants 
  in the watering hole, then it will only eat 2 plants 
  when it forages.
• Your species does not have enough hungry population
  .
A species may never eat more food than it has hungry population 
 . If your species can forage for 
4, but it only has 1 hungry population 
 , then it will only eat 1 plant 
  when it forages, and the 
remaining 3 will stay in the watering hole.
 
Jeffrey has a size 1 species with 4 population 
 . It eats 3 plants 
  when it forages; 1 
plant 
  for its size and 2 plants 
  because of the Clawed trait. Jeffrey takes 3 plants 
 from the watering hole and places them on 3 hungry population 
 . One of its 
population 
  is still hungry, so Jeffrey will have to wait to feed this species again on a 
subsequent turn. Hopefully, there will still be food in the watering hole!

--- Page 16 ---
16
Hunting
A species that received a Hunter trait during the Adapting Phase is a hunter. 
Hunters can hunt before or after the watering hole runs out of plants 
 .
A hunter may hunt another species if the hunter:
• is hungry.
• has a hunt value 
  equal to or greater than the defense value  of its prey.
• can overcome the defense traits of its prey (such as Fast).
After a successful hunt:
1. The hunter kills 1 population of the hunted species. The player who 
controls the hunted species chooses which population
  to flip over. This 
dead population
  will get flipped back to the living side
  and added to 
their new species at the start of the next round.
2. If the population
  that was killed had a food token on it, return the food to the supply.
3.  The hunter eats meat 
  from the supply equal to the size of the hunted species. Place each eaten meat 
 on top of a hungry population
  of the hunter. Any extra meat 
  remains in the supply.
A hungry hunter must hunt if there is available prey, regardless of who controls that species. For example, your 
hunter must hunt a species with the Horned trait, even if that that species belong to you!
Dom’s species has a hunt value 
  of 5: 3 for its size 
and +2 from Clawed. Maddie’s species has a defense 
value  of 5: 3 for its size and +2 from Tusked, so 
Maddie’s species is a legal target for the hunt.
Maddie flips over one population 
   
  from 
the hunted species. It will be added to Maddie’s new 
species next round. Dom’s species eats 3 meat
  
because Maddie’s species is size 3. He takes them 
from the supply and places them on three of his 
hungry population
 . Dom will need to feed his 2 
remaining hungry population
  on a future turn.

Starving
If you are unable to forage or hunt with any of your species, you must choose 1 hungry population 
  to 
starve. Flip over the population 
   
  to show it was killed. It will be added to your new species at the 
beginning of the next round. If this is the species’ last population
 , it has become extinct. See Extinction 
below.
Passing
On your turn you must pass if you don’t feed any of your species and you don’t have any hungry population 
  
to starve. Once you pass, your turn will be skipped for the remainder of the Feeding Phase.
FREE ACTION
Before taking a feeding action (foraging, hunting, starving, or passing), 
you may discard one or more cards from your hand to add plants 
  to 
the watering hole. Add plants 
  equal to the food value(s) indicated in 
the bottom right corner of the discarded card(s). 
EXTINCTION
A species goes extinct when its last population
  is killed or starves. Do the 
following if one of your species goes extinct:
• Place its killed population
  and its size dial 
  next to your player 
screen. They will be added to your new species next round. See 
Preparation on page 7. 
• If the species had a Hunter trait, return it to the Hunter deck.
• Return its other trait(s) to your hand. These cards 
are available immediately, which means you can 
discard them to add food 
  to the watering hole 
during the current Feeding Phase. 
Reminder: There is no maximum hand size. You will get 
5 additional cards during Preparation in the next round.

Remove the plant 
  and meat 
  from your fed population
 /
 and place them behind your player 
screen. They will each be worth 1 point at the end of the game.
If there are plants 
  remaining in the watering hole, leave them there. You will add additional plants 
  next 
round during Preparation. 
The game ends after Round 4. If this is the end of Round 4, proceed to the Game End section. Otherwise, pass 
the awesome snow leopard to the left and begin a new round, starting with Preparation. 
To determine the success of your species in Nature, each player scores:
• 1 point for every plant 
  and and every meat 
  behind their player screen.
• 2 points as a Game End Bonus for each surviving species.
The player with the most points wins.
If there is a tie, the player with the most traits on their surviving 
species wins. If there is still a tie, order two pizzas—a vegetarian and a 
meat lovers—and play again!

Nature is a modular game system. Once players are familiar with the core game, consider adding a module to 
customize your experience. You can add one location module to change the ecosystem’s setting, and as many 
other modules as you like. Every combination creates a unique ecosystem to discover!
Each Nature module is designed for a unique style of play. A module might add bluffing, or dramatic events, 
favor aggressive players, or benefit those who avoid conflict. You can learn about the Nature modules at 
NorthStarGames.com.
VARIABLE LENGTH
You can play additional rounds to Nature if you’d like a longer game. Each additional round adds about 20 
minutes to the game. Adding several modules and 2 rounds turns Nature into an epic 2 hour game!
QUICK PLAY VARIANT 
In this variant, everyone plays their cards during the Adapting 
Phase simultaneously, without looking at what actions their 
opponents are taking. This variant can be chaotic, but it more 
closely represents how random mutations drive evolution 
through natural selection. 
5-6 PLAYER RULES
Play with the Quick Play Variant to minimize downtime.

What happens if we run out of a component?
Components are unlimited. Use something in its place such as a coin, a die, or a plastic miniature you never use 
from an expensive Kickstarter campaign.
Can I choose to eat less food than the written amount?
No, but sometimes your species will not eat the full amount because it does not have enough hungry population
 .
Can I add the lost 
  and size from the previous round to any species? 
No, they must be added to your new species.
Do I get anything for the card I lose if I discard a trait from my species?
No.
During the Feeding Phase, can I discard traits from my species to add food to the watering hole?
No, a discarded card must come from your hand.
If my size 4 species goes extinct, does my new species come in the next round at size 5?
No. The maximum size is indicated on the size dial 
 . In Nature, the largest number on the size dial 
  is 4.
Who chooses which population 
  is killed when a species is hunted?
The player controlling the species that lost a population 
  chooses which population 
  is killed. It may be a 
hungry population 
  or a fed population 
 /
 .
Can I hold onto cards I kept in my hand from one round to the next?
Yes. Any saved cards are added to the 5 cards you draw at the beginning of the next round. There is no limit to 
your hand size.
What happens when I remove a trait that turned my species into a hunter? 
Flip over the size dial 
 . The species is now a forager. It cannot hunt.
Is a triggered ability optional? 
No. The ability happens every time the trigger condition is met. The word “may” is needed to make 
something optional.

Our story begins with Darwin’s revolutionary theory of evolution: that 
random mutations shaped by natural selection over millions of years, 
have led to the incredible diversity of life on Earth. Inspired by this 
concept, Russian biologist Dmitry Knorre created a scientific game as a 
gift for friends, which eventually became Evolution: The Origin of Species.
Dmitry’s game served as the foundation for the international  
award-winning hit Evolution, which gained recognition from Nature, 
the world’s leading scientific journal.
The Nature article sparked widespread interest, with other scientific journals highlighting the 
game and hundreds of universities and schools adopting it as a teaching tool. It was a dream 
come true to see Evolution bridging science and game design, but its widespread use also revealed 
opportunities for improvement.
With over a decade of experience designing the Evolution series, Dominic Crapuchettes completely 
reimagined the game from the ground up. The result is Nature—a streamlined, engaging, and 
endlessly expandable system that allows players to craft and discover limitless ecosystems.

OUR SUSTAINABILITY PLEDGE
All Versions of Nature are Completely Biodegradable
Creating a new game about nature inspired us to minimize our environmental impact. Instead of 
plastic, we made Nature biodegradable, using paper storage, wooden dice, and polylactic acid for 
spinner pins. We believe small steps like these help contribute to a larger solution for climate change.
