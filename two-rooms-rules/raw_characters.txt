AGENT
Private Reveal Power, Verbalization
AGENT
You have the AGENT power: once per round, you may privately reveal your card to a player and force 
that player to card share with you. You must verbally say to the target player, “I’m using my AGENT 
power. You must card share with me.”
Note: The AGENT power works even on characters that normally can’t card share (e.g. Shy Guy and Coy Boy).
Characters that have card share powers or restrictions recommended.
10 players or fewer not recommended. Contains character exceptions.
+
_
11 or more players recommended.
Do not bury Ambassadors. There must be 2 Ambassadors for proper game balance.
+
_
You win as long as you never leave your initial room.
You win if Moby is in the same room as the Bomber at the end of the game and you are not. 
Traveler recommended.
Difficult to win with characters that force room changes (e.g. Bouncer).
+
_
Literary references at their finest!
Playing without the Wife and Mistress may provide Red Team with an advantage.
+
_
As soon as you are dealt your card, announce “I am an Ambassador!” Your card is permanently publicly 
revealed. You have the “immune ” condition. Players with the “immune” condition are immune to 
all powers and conditions. Ambassadors can walk freely between the 2 rooms. Ambassadors are never 
considered a part of a room’s population. Therefore, Ambassadors  can never take part in any vote, be  
hostages, be leaders, and they can never be targeted by abilities.
Note: Ambassadors don’t count towards the player count in the game. This means if you have 18 
players including the Ambassadors, you should be playing a 16 player game. Ambassadors don’t 
count for or against Team Zombie’s win objective.

would cancel one another, leaving the player with neither condition.

color share unless a character’s power forces otherwise. 
Note: The “coy” condition is a psych condition and can be cured by a

verbally tell your target players, “You are in love with each other.” Those 2 players gain the “in love” 
condition. Players with the “in love” condition replace their original win objective with the following 
win objective: Be in the same room with the player with whom you are “in love” at the end of the game 
or fail to win. The CUPID power cannot be used on yourself.
Note: If a player with the “in love” condition were to acquire the “in hate” condition, the 2 conditions

never turn down an offer to card or color share.

means that you are permitted to tell the truth as long as it is not verbally.  
Note: If a player with the “liar” condition were to acquire the “honest” condition, the 2 conditions 
would cancel one another, leaving the player with neither condition.
When playing with the Doctor, the Blue Team has the following additional win condition: the President 
must card share with the Doctor before the end of the game or the Blue Team  loses. At the end of the 
game, the President will be asked if he/she card shared with the Doctor. At that time both players will 
verify or deny having card shared.
When playing with the Engineer, the Red Team has the following additional win condition: the Bomber 
must card share with the Engineer before the end of the game or the Red Team loses. At the end of the 
game, the Bomber will be asked if he/she card shared with the Engineer. At that time both players will 
verify or deny having card shared.
Note: remember that if the President or Bomber character ever switches player control (perhaps 
due to the Hot Potato), then the new President/Bomber must card share with the Doctor/Engineer to 
prevent losing.

Characters with card share powers recommended.
Games can last less than 30 seconds. Without Tuesday Knight, Red Team  has an 
advantage. Doesn’t work well with characters that pause the game.

_
This is a crowd favorite card.
Subtly trading the Drunk card for the “sober” card is difficult.
+
_
You have the BOOM power: if you card share with the President, everyone in the same room as you 
instantly gains the “dead” condition and the game ends.
Note: the BOOM power never works on the President’s Daughter . If the President is buried, the 
BOOM power is never used.
Before characters cards are dealt but after they are shuffled, randomly remove a character card. This is 
the “sober” character card. Place the “sober” card facedown in a location easily accessible to all players 
(usually between the 2 rooms). Then shuffle the  Drunk card into the remaining deck of character cards. 
At the beginning of the last round of the game, the Drunk character should trade their Drunk card with 
the “sober” card. Assume all powers and responsibilities associated with the “sober” character card. 
You lose if you forget or are unable to trade your card for the “sober” card.
Note: The “sober” card is always cleansed when it is first retrieved, meaning it has no acquired 
conditions.
Another Note: If you don’t retrieve the “sober” card at the beginning of the last round, you’re still 
considered to be the “sober” character.

verbally tell your target players, “You hate each other.” Those 2 players gain the “in hate” condition. 
Players with the “in hate” condition replace their original win objective with the following win objective: 
be in the opposite room of the player with whom you are “in hate” at the end of the game or fail to win. 
You cannot use this power on yourself.
Note: If a player with the “in hate” condition were to acquire the “in love” condition, the 2 conditions 
would cancel one another, leaving that specific player with neither condition.
At the end of the last round, before all players reveal their cards, you must publicly announce which 
team (Red Team, Blue Team, or neither) you think won the game. Win only if you are correct.
Note: You have a pause game number of 10. Only pause the game and make your announcement after 
all characters with a lower pause game number (e.g. Private Eye) have finished their announcements.
You have the HOT POTATO power: any player that card shares or color shares with you immediately trades cards 
with you. Both you and the other player assume the powers and the allegiance of the newly acquired cards. The Hot 
Potato loses at the end of the game.
Note: Due to the cleanse rule (see page 13), any previously acquired conditions (e.g. “cursed ”) are lost when 
receiving a new character card.

--- Page 10 ---
You win if you are in the same room as the President at the end of the game.
You win if you are in the same room as Romeo and the Bomber at the end of the game.

immediately trades cards with you. Both you and the other player assume the powers and the allegiance of the newly 
acquired cards. At the end of the game, the Leprechaun  wins. A single player can only ever be the Leprechaun once 
per game. If a player is about to become the Leprechaun character for the second time, they must communicate that 
they can’t receive the Leprechaun card. 
Note: Due to the cleanse rule (see page 13), any previously acquired conditions (e.g. “cursed ”) are lost when 
receiving a new character card. 
Another Note: If a player with the “foolish” condition were to acquire a contradictory condition (e.g. “shy ” or 
“coy”), the 2 conditions would cancel one another, leaving the player with neither condition.

become the leader. However, your card must permanently remain publicly revealed for the rest of the 
game. This means that you can only use this power once. You cannot be usurped during the same round 
in which you used your USURPER power, not even by another Usurper. If 2 Usurpers use their power 
in the same room during the same round, whichever Usurper used their power first remains the leader, 
the other Usurper wasted their power. 
You win if you are in the same room as the Bomber at the end of the game.
You win if you are in the same room as the President at the end of the game and the Mistress is not.

You begin with the “zombie ” condition. The “zombie ” condition provides a replacement win 
condition. Players with the “zombie” condition win if Team Zombie wins. Team Zombie wins if all 
players without the “dead” condition at the end of the game are on Team Zombie. Any player that card 
shares or color shares with a player that has the “zombie” condition gains the “zombie” condition. 
Note: “zombie” players without a Zombie character card must indicate to players with whom they 
card share or color share that they now also have the “zombie ” condition. Typically this is done by 
saying something like, “I’m a Zombie, and now so are you.”
