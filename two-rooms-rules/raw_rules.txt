In Two Rooms and a Boom there are 2 teams and 2 rooms. 
The 2 teams are the Red Team and the Blue Team. The Blue Team 
has a President.  The Red Team has a Bomber.  Players are first 
equally distributed between 2 separate playing areas (usually 
2 separate rooms) and then each player is randomly dealt a 
facedown character card.
Players play the game by saying what they want in order to select 
a leader for their room. The leader chooses hostages (players 
that will be sent to the other room at the end of the round).
The game consists of 3 timed rounds. Each round is shorter than the 
previous round. At the end of each round, the hostages selected by the 
leaders will be traded into opposing rooms. 
 
The game ends after the last hostage 
exchange.  
Everyone reveals their card. If Red 
Team’s Bomber is in the same room as 
the President, then the Red Team wins.  
Otherwise the Blue Team wins.

--- Page 4 ---
1. SET Up THE CHARACTER DECK. The character deck consists of the 
Bomber card, the President card, and an equal number of Red Team and 
Blue Team cards. There will be one character card for each player in the 
game. If you are playing with an odd number of players, include the Gambler  
card (see Gambler section on page 10). Shuffle the character deck.
2. SEpARATE pLAyERS InTO 2 ROOMS. Players should be separated 
randomly and as evenly as possible. The “rooms” can be separated by a 
wall, door, or simply two open areas at a distance from each other. It is not 
important if players can see one another, but players in the separate rooms 
shouldn’t be able to hear one another.
3. DEAL CHARACTER CARDS. Every player receives 1 facedown 
character card. The character cards are secret but can be 
revealed during the game. Players should not look at their own 
cards until the game begins.
4. START THE TIMER. Now the game begins with the first round. 
The first round of the game lasts 3 minutes. The second round 
is 2 minutes, and the last round is 1 minute.
Note: Check out www.tworoomsandaboom.com/music for timer 
alternatives!
SETUP

--- Page 5 ---
1. TIME IS pUBLIC. Round time can be kept by anyone with a stopwatch. 
Time is never kept secret. The end of a round should be clear to all 
players.
2. STAy In yOUR ROOM. You can’t just mosey into the other room whenever 
you feel like it.
3. nO COMMUnICATIOn BETwEEn ROOMS. 
No yelling anything to players in the other 
room. No eavesdropping. Even if you can 
see into the other room, there is no sign 
language permitted.
4. KEEp yOUR CARD. Do what you want with 
your character card. Show it to someone, 
everyone, or nobody. However, no swapping 
character cards with another player, and if 
you are going to show someone your card, you 
have to show all of it. You can’t just show 
the color of your card.
5. LEADERS AnD HOSTAGES HAVE MORE RULES. I guess there are more 
than 4 basic rules. While you can’t count on us to count too well, you can 
count on us to explain more rules. See Leaders & Hostages on the next page.
THE 4 BASIC RULES
 5

--- Page 6 ---
THE fIRST LEADER of a room is the player 
that is appointed by another player. To 
appoint a player, point to them and say, “I 
appoint you as leader!” A player can never 
appoint themselves. The new leader then 
takes the leader card as a visual identifier. 
Leadership should never be a secret.
THE nUMBER Of HOSTAGES a leader chooses at 
the end of a round depends on the round and the 
total number of players. The number of hostages 
is listed on the leader card and the chart on the next 
page.
LEADERS & HOSTAGES
The leader is the player who holds 
the leader card and chooses the 
hostages to leave the room at the 
end of the round. REMEMBER! Leaders 
can’t be hostages.
PRO TIP: Instead of wasting your time reading this, you could be watching our
awesome tutorial videos at http://www.tworoomsandaboom.com

--- Page 7 ---
IMPORTANT: Before beginning the game, pay attention to how many players are in 
the game as this dictates how many hostages are exchanged at the end of each round.
LEADERS & HOSTAGES (CONTINUED)
Hostages are the player(s) who 
are chosen by the leader to leave 
the room at the end of a round. 
REMEMBER! Leaders can’t 
be hostages.

1. LEADER ABDICATES. 
If you are leader and don’t want to be (usually because 
you want to be a hostage), then simply hand the 
leader card to a willing player. The player may 
accept or refuse leadership, but if they do accept 
leadership, they can’t give it back to you until the next 
round. No givesy-backsies. 
 2. LEADER IS USURpED. 
If there is still time in a round and you want 
a different leader, raise one hand into the air 
(so your usurping attempt is clearly visible) and 
point your other hand toward the player you 
want as the new leader. Note: you can point 
to yourself. Once a majority of players in the 
room (more than half) are pointing to a single 
player, that player becomes the new leader and 
receives the leader card. 
CHANGING LEADERS
Want a different leader?
Here are the 2 ways 
to do that!
8

--- Page 9 ---
At the end of every round, the room leaders must perform the following 5 
steps in order:
1. LEADER SELECTS HOSTAGES. Indicate your hostage selection to the 
players in your room. Players in your room need to know who was selected 
as hostages because you can’t change your mind once hostages are 
selected and you can’t choose yourself. (For the number of hostages to 
send, see your leader card or page 7.)
2. LEADERS pARLEy by meeting between the 2 rooms without hostages. 
Leaders meet without their hostages so that if one room’s leader is slow 
selecting hostages they aren’t influenced by seeing the other room’s incoming 
hostages. Trust us, this is important.
3. LEADERS BEGIn TIMER for the next round. If this is the last round (the 1 
minute round), then skip this step.
4. ExCHAnGE HOSTAGES by calling over your selected hostages. An equal 
amount of hostages should be traded from both rooms into the other. If 
this was the last round, the game ends (see GAME OVER section on the next 
page). 
5. RETURn TO yOUR ROOM if everything went smoothly. If not, you may 
need to reread this section.
END OF A ROUND 9

--- Page 10 ---
AfTER THE LAST HOSTAGE ExCHAnGE, the game ends. Everyone 
reveals their cards (unless playing with the Gambler, see Gambler section 
below). If the President is in the room with Bomber, then the entire Red 
Team wins. If the President is not in the room with the Bomber, then the 
entire Blue Team wins.
GAMBLER. When playing with an odd number of 
players, shuffle in the grey Gambler card 
with the other character cards. If you are 
the Gambler, pause the game by showing 
everyone your card at the end of the last 
round (the 1 minute round). This should 
be done before all other players 
reveal their cards. Don’t worry, players 
should wait for you. This isn’t a race. 
You must then verbally announce who 
you think is about to win the game (Red 
Team or Blue Team). You win if your 
prediction is correct, so don’t worry 
about anything else. 
ADVAnCED GAME. Once you get familiar enough with the Basic Game, try 
the Advanced Game with more rounds, characters, and 3 additional rules!
GAME OVER

ADVANCED GAME RULES
Once you get familiar enough with the Basic 
Game, try the Advanced Game with more 
rounds, characters, and 3 additional rules!
1. SHOwInG COLORS. If you have more than 
10 players, players are no longer limited to 
just showing all of their card. Instead, players 
may only show part of their card if they want.
2. MORE CHARACTERS. You can play 
with advanced character cards that modify the basic rules of the game. 
If an advanced character card contradicts a basic game rule, then the 
advanced character’s rule should be followed.
3. MORE ROUnDS? Try adding a 5 minute round and a 4 minute round, but 
only if you have more than 10 players. If you don’t have enough players, 
stick with 3 rounds (see your leader card). 
Let’s spice it up
with an advanced 
game!

ADDITIONAL RULES
BURyInG A CARD In this game, it is possible to deal a card to nobody. This is called 
“burying a card” and the card dealt to nobody is the “buried card.” Burying a card is a great 
idea if you have an odd number of players (instead of using a team neutral card, for instance). 
However, when you bury a card, you must make sure that the Martyr and President’s Daughter 
are shuffled into the character deck. Otherwise, you might bury the President or Bomber and be 
without a substitute. 
 
BURyInG (nOn-BURIES) In this game, there are some character cards that require that 
there be a buried card, and there are some characters that are linked, meaning they can’t be 
buried. You can actually play games with linked characters and bury a card. Simply separate 
the linked character cards from the others. Shuffle the non-linked character cards and then 
randomly choose a single buried card from that deck. Afterwards, combine the linked cards into 
the deck, reshuffle, deal, and then play as usual. 
 
BURyInG (EVEnS) Burying a card can be done even if there is an even number of players. 
This also opens up a bunch of new character roles for Two Rooms and a Boom. Because of 
this, it is perfectly acceptable (and encouraged) to bury a card with an even number of players. 
Just be sure that when playing with a buried card, you must play with the President’s backup 
character (the President’s Daughter), and the Bomber’s backup character (the Martyr).
CHAnGInG ROUnD TIMES (VARIAnT) Some players may find the original game format 
unsuitable for their taste. Consider trying a game structure where each round last 3 minutes. It 
is still recommended that the hostage exchange numbers in each round remain the same even if 
the time limit does not. 
12

--- Page 13 ---
ADDITIONAL RULES 
DOn’T ASK DOn’T SHARE A player should never ask to share if they don’t intend to do 
so. If a player asks to share (e.g. “Do you want to color share?”) they are then obligated to share 
if the player they ask agrees. 
 
nEw CARD = CLEAn CARD When a player gains a new character card, that card is 
cleansed. It is the same as if that character was dealt that card at the very beginning of the game. 
This means that if a player acquires a new character card during the game (usually due to card 
swapping), that player would lose all previously acquired conditions. 
nO TIMER (VARIAnT) It is possible to have rounds without time limits, therefore requiring 
no timer at all. To do this, after a leader has publicly announced their hostage(s), they may wait 
in the “hallway” between the 2 rooms for the opposing leader. At this point, they may audibly 
signal the other room that they are ready.
 
pRIVACy pROMISE (VARIAnT) Some players prefer to have guaranteed privacy whenever 
doing any card sharing or color sharing. The Privacy Promise rule variant forces all players to 
do any card sharing or color sharing in a secluded private area away from the prying eyes of 
other players (like a bathroom). This works really well when playing with any characters that 
might give away their identity when others witness the sharing process (e.g. Hot Potato).
pREMATURE LOSS (VARIAnT) There are advanced characters that can lose during the first 
round (e.g. Agoraphobe). The Premature Loss variant allows grey characters that lose the game 
prior to the last round to treat their card as a Gambler card. This is an alternative win objective, 
allowing these players to remain involved in the game to gain some type of redeeming win.

GLOSSARY
ALLEGIAnCE - the team a card is 
on. Red Team cards share a common win 
objective, as do all Blue Team cards. Any 
other teams have specified win objectives 
defined by the details of their character card.
BACKUp CHARACTER - a 
character that assumes the powers of the 
specified character if that specified character 
is not in play.
BURIED - a card that is out of play. When 
playing with an odd number 
of players, or when spicing the 
game up, one character card is 
“buried.”
CLEAnSE - to lose all acquired 
conditions (see Condition below). A cleansed 
character is as it was at the very beginning 
of the game. Note: whenever a player gains 
a new character card, that character card is 
automatically cleansed. 
COnDITIOn - a type of affliction that 
may affect the way in which a character plays 
the game. For ease of reference, conditions are 
placed within quotes.
HOSTAGE - the player(s) the leader of a 
room chooses to leave the room at the end of 
a round.
LEADER - the nominated player that 
chooses the hostages to leave the room at the 
end of a round.
LInKED - characters that can require 
another character to be in the game in order 
to function.
pOwER - a special ability that can’t be 
deactivated. Players must use their power 
when indicated, even if it isn’t in their best 
interest. 
For ease of 
reference in 
the Character 
Guide, powers 
are in all caps.
14

--- Page 15 ---
GLOSSARY
REVEAL - a player exposes their character 
card without expecting other players to do the 
same. There are 4 types of revealing:
     pRIVATE REVEAL - exposing your card to 
just one player.
     pUBLIC REVEAL - exposing your card to 
multiple players. A permanent public reveal 
indicates a player must do nothing with their 
card but keep it in plain sight. 
     CARD REVEAL - exposing your entire 
character card. 
     COLOR REVEAL - exposing just the color 
portion of your character card. This is only 
allowed in a game with more than 10 players.
SHARE - 2 players consenting to showing 
one another the same information about their 
own character cards. There are 2 types of 
sharing:
     CARD SHARE - 2 players temporarily 
exchange character cards to completely share 
card information.
     COLOR SHARE - 2 players only expose the 
color portion of their character cards to one 
another. This is only allowed in a game with 
more than 10 players.
SwAp - trading cards with another player. 
Note: whenever a player gains a new character 
card, that character card is automatically 
cleansed. 
wIn OBjECTIVE - the goal a player 
must accomplish to win the game. Besides 
original win objectives, there are 3 different 
types of win objectives:
     ADDITIOnAL wIn OBjECTIVE
 - having 
more than 1 win objective. Failing to complete 
any and all additional win objectives means 
the player loses.
     ALTERnATE wIn OBjECTIVE
 - having 
more than 1 possible win objective. 
Successfully completing any single alternate 
win objective means the player wins.
     REpLACEMEnT wIn OBjECTIVE
 - having 
a new win objective instead of your original 
win objective. Failure to complete the 
replacement win objective means the player 
loses.
